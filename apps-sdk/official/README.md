# Apps SDK Official Quickstart Scaffold

This folder mirrors the official Apps SDK quickstart (todo MCP server + widget).

The MCP endpoint will be available at:

```

## Notes

- This is the official quickstart code copied from the Apps SDK quickstart page.
- Use it as a baseline, then replace tools and UI with your own app logic.
